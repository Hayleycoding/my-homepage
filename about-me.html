    <h3>About me</h3>
    <section>
        <p>My name is Hayley and I have been wanting to code for <em>YEARS</em><br>
            I feel like a teenager again by making my own website. <br>
            The last time I did this was <em>many</em> moons ago on myspace.<br>
            Anyone remember that ? <br>
            If you wanted a cool page, you had to learn some coding to get <br>
            the cool images and videos on your page. <br>
            I have tried over the years since 2020 and I haven given up because<br>
            of home commitments and also imposter sydnrome. I decided that<br>
            if I don't just try and give it what I have I will regret it<br>
            And so here I am.<br>
            No regrets.
        </p>

        <h2>How am I learning to code?</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am following the full stack Free Code Camp course.<br>
            I am also using Chat GPT to my advantage and asking it <em>so</em> many questions.<br>
            It has been a huge help, as long as you double check things as it is not<br>
            always correct as I have seen. I am following the full stack path but also letting myself<br>
            drift down the rabbit hole of whatever I feel like on the way. Some say that isn't good<br>
            but I have found it great. An example being learning to use GITHub. Now I have<br>
            been uploading on there I am addicted to the little green squares and I want to fill them up!<br> </p>
