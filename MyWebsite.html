    <h3>About me</h3>
    <section>
        <p>My name is Hayley and I feel like a teenager again by making my own website. <br>
            The last time I did this was <em>many</em> moons ago on myspace.<br>
            Anyone remember that ? <br>
            If you wanted a cool page, you had to learn a <br>
            bit of coding to get cool images and videos
            on it. </p>
        <section>
            <h1>How am I learning to code?</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am following the full stack Free Code Camp course.</p>

    <h1>My favourite band</h1>
    <h1>Architects</h1>
    <p>Architects are a British band from Brighton.<br>
        I found them in the pandemic (2020) and
        I haven't stopped listening to them since.</p>
